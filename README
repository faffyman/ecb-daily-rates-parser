ECB Rate Updater
=================

Read the daily rates from the EuropeanCentral Bank.
Parse the XMl and store the rates as json in a local file.

Also store the previous day's rates so that a daily comparison can be made.


Files
------

### rate-update.php
This is the class that grabs the data and stores it. Probably execute this via a cron job.

### currencies.json
simple local file storage of the ECB data. Used for simplicity, but if you
have a database setup, use that instead.

### currency-convertor.php
This class is used in an example page, using the data to list all the rates against a single base currency
and to display a simple web form offering the user the chance to convert a currency.

### index.php
This is the example page.


### /tpl/*.tpl
These are smarty templates that could be used/amended. Not used in this example code.


Example Usage
------------------

// grabbing the latest data is as simple as:-
$oRU = new RateUpdate();
$oRU->getNewRates();



Database
---------

This class doesn't use any database integration at all. However it's just a matter of
adding your own storage function and choosing how long to store the numbers for.
